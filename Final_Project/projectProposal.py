Final Project: 2d, top-down, dungeon crawler game.
Explore, fight monsters, get loot

First Major Milestone: Moving charectar around map
Don't know?: How to generate worlds
How is project too ambitious?: Many things that I do not know currently, something could be much harder than I think
In what ways is your project not ambitous enough?: Gameplay could be very simple, it is possible that what I want to do is too hard
and what I end up with is not good enough.
